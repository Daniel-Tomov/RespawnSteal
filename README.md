# LifeSteal
Made based off a plugin request on the Bukkit Forums https://bukkit.org/threads/respawn-steal.494735/

# Commands
/respawnsteal add <player name> - adds a respawn to a player

/respawnsteal take <player name> - takes a respawn from a player

/respawnsteal reload - reloads config. Currently does nothing

Others commands:

/respawnsteal rc - puts respawns into respawns.yml


/respawnsteal rr - takes respawns from respawns.yml and puts them into list. Be careful with this one as it can remove respawns for players that are online and that bugs the plugin.
