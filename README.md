# RespawnSteal
Made based off a plugin request on the Bukkit Forums https://bukkit.org/threads/lifesteal-plugin-skript.494790/

# Commands
/lifesteal add <player name> - adds a respawn to a player

/lifesteal remove <player name> - takes a respawn from a player

/lifesteal reload - reloads config. Does not reload the crafting recipe. A full server restart is needed for that.

Others commands:

/lifesteal lc - puts heart amount for every player into lives.yml

/lifesteal rl - takes player hearts from lives.yml and puts them into list. Be careful with this one as it can remove hearts for players that are online and that bugs the plugin.
